## Installation Steps

1. Install Python: Download and install Python (version 3.10.5 recommended) from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to your PATH during installation.

2. Install project dependencies: Open a terminal or command prompt, and run the following command to install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Build and run the application: Execute the following command to start the Streamlit server and launch the chatbot application: streamlit run chatbot.py

After running the command, Streamlit will provide a URL (usually http://localhost:8501) that you can open in your web browser to access the application.

NOTE: API keys for OpenAI and Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) need to be put in the "secrets.toml" file, located within the ".streamlit" folder in the project directory. Please replace the existing keys with your own API keys to ensure proper functionality.
